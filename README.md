# Predicting Mortality Risk from Cigarette Smoking Using Machine Learning and Interpretable Statistical Models

Rationale: Cigarette smoking is a major contributor to preventable mortality worldwide, yet substantial heterogeneity exists in smoking behaviors and associated health risks. Accurately predicting mortality risk across diverse smoking profiles is critical for effective risk stratification and targeted intervention. While traditional statistical models offer interpretability, they are often not optimized for predictive performance, whereas machine learning approaches emphasize risk prediction but may lack transparency

Objective: The goal of this analysis is to develop and evaluate predictive models for mortality risk associated with cigarette smoking, prioritizing accurate risk stratification and subsequently using statistical models to provide interpretable insights into key risk factors.  

Dataset: US National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) Tobacco Use Cohort (dataset filename : tu) - 493,282 observations of 43 different variables including demographic information, socioeconomic factors, and smoking behaviors (5 year follow-up data)
